# javascript 2.5D shooter

A side scrolling 2.5D shooter made in javascript.

- version 0.1 - only the basics you got the base website, the simple style and a movable square, and a lot of placeholders
		- if I feel like it tommorow I will do the shooting mechanic and make the background scroll with the players movement
- version 0.1.5 - Some improvement has been made. The player is no longer a square. You can shoot now even tho there is nothing to shoot
		- at. The sprite looks like shit but I will fix it. So stuff I want to get done is : enemies, a background, a good looking sprite
- version 0.2 - The enemies have arrived they are currently red squares with healthbars above them. A simple level progression has also been added
		- it doesnt really work. So stuff I want to get done is: a background, a good looking sprite, functionall level progression, sprites
		- for the enemies
- version 0.3 - The sprite is in a okay condition. I also added a pause menu and a main menu. A cheat console and some cheat codes have also been added
	      - The background is also done it looks ok not great but ok. Tbh I forgor what I did sooo yeah. So stuff I want to get done is: enemy sprites
	      - items, item store that randomly appears, maybe sound effects
